Hangman Console Game
Overview
Hangman Console Game is a single-player, text-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman, written in Python. The game selects a random word from a predefined list and provides the player with feedback on their guesses, while keeping track of used letters and remaining guesses.

Features
Random word selection from a predefined list
Accepts uppercase and lowercase letters
Input validation for single-letter guesses
Displays guessed letters and remaining guesses
Win or lose game endings based on player's progress
Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-console-game.git
`

Navigate to the project directory:

`
cd hangman-console-game
`

Run the game:

`
python hangman.py
`

How to Play
Run the game using the command python hangman.py.
The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters in the randomly chosen word.
Guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter. The game accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters.
The game provides feedback on your guesses, showing the correctly guessed letters in the word or informing you of incorrect guesses.
Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly (win) or run out of guesses (lose).
The game will display the result (win or lose) and the correct word at the end of the game.
